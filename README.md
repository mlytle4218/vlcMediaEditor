# Command Line Video editor for visually impaired

This is for editing audio and video by audio only. It relies on videoLan to play the audio/video. It tracks the *edits* by creating blocks to be removed. When finished, it passes that information on to ffmpeg with timecode blocks that are be be kept. (The opposite of the editing process.) It re-encodes the file with only the wanted sections of the file kept.
